CrowdTask - Taskyy - Crowdsourced Assignment Evaluation

CrowdTask (stupid temporary title) is a software that lets you setup a self-managed platform for people to assign tasks to each other (or themselves), which can then be evaluated by either the assigning person or an evaluation can happen in a crowd-sourced manner.

Further descriptions will follow as my plan for this piece of software becomes more detailed during the implementation ... please stand by.
